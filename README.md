# Your Project Title

## Description 

Here is your perfect daily planner! Utilizing a planner can dramatically change your life, and how you use your time. This planner was designed for time blocking each hour of the day.


The user can easily enter and save events for the day, and the color theme is based on the time of day! Green for the future, gray for the past, and red for the current hour.

During the creation of this project I sharpened my tools in dayjs and learned how to create a live clock and display it in an application. Then I learned how to attach properties to my application based on the time.
